# opc\_compute\_storage\_volume

The ``opc_compute_storage_volume`` resource creates and manages a storage volume in an OPC identity domain.

~> **Caution:** The ``opc_compute_storage_volume`` resource can completely delete your storage volume just as easily as it can create it. To avoid costly accidents, consider setting [``prevent_destroy``](/docs/configuration/resources.html#prevent_destroy) on your storage volume resources as an extra safety measure.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "opc_compute_storage_volume" "test" {
  name        = "storageVolume1"
  description = "Description for the Storage Volume"
  size        = 10
  tags        = ["bar", "foo"]
}
```

##Â Example Usage (Bootable Volume)
```hcl
data "opc_compute_image_list_entry" "test" {
  image_list = "my_image_list"
  version    = 1
}

resource "opc_compute_storage_volume" "test" {
  name             = "storageVolume1"
  description      = "Description for the Bootable Storage Volume"
  size             = 30
  tags             = ["first", "second"]
  bootable         = true
  image_list       = "${data.opc_compute_image_list_entry.test.image_list}"
  image_list_entry = "${data.opc_compute_image_list_entry.test.version}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `snapshot` - (Optional) The name of the parent snapshot from which the storage volume is restored or cloned.
* `snapshot_id` - (Optional) The Id of the parent snapshot from which the storage volume is restored or cloned.
* `snapshot_account` - (Optional) The Account of the parent snapshot from which the storage volume is restored.
* `tags` - (Optional) Comma-separated strings that tag the storage volume.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `hypervisor` - The hypervisor that this volume is compatible with.
* `machine_image` - Name of the Machine Image - available if the volume is a bootable storage volume.
* `managed` - Is this a Managed Volume?
